## 🎯 Overview

Reclaim AI addresses the growing crisis of digital violence against individuals through two integrated pillars:

1. **Digital Safety Learning Hub** -  micro-courses with AI-powered tutoring, interactive quizzes, and reward systems
2. **AI Evidence Collection & Reporting System** - Secure, encrypted vault for documenting abuse with automated harm detection and legal report generation

Our mission is to transform digital safety education from reactive to proactive, empowering women and girls with knowledge and tools before, during, and after experiencing digital violence.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Across Africa, digital violence against women is reaching crisis levels. One in three women experience online harassment, yet over 80% never report incidents due to lack of evidence, fear of retaliation, or insufficient awareness of their digital rights. Traditional evidence collection methods are unreliable, screenshots can be dismissed, and legal systems often lack the expertise to handle digital abuse cases.

Women face sophisticated threats including deepfake manipulation, romance scams, image-based abuse, doxxing, and coordinated harassment campaigns. Without proper tools and education, victims remain vulnerable while perpetrators act with impunity. The gap between the sophistication of digital abuse and victims' ability to protect themselves continues to widen.
